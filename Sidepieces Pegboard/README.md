# DDD Printable Pegboard Sidepieces

This addition replicates some of the Sidepiece models, which are those which are physically inserted into the backing “wall” surface. The Wall Control slot mounts have been replaced with peg mounts for standard 1" pegboard mounts. The target hole size is ¼", which also seems to be standard.

You'll notice that the pegs that get mounted into the pegboard are not completely cylindrical - this is by design. This allows the sidepieces to be compatible in size with all the existing models for the DDD system, as well as removing the need for any support when printing. These pegs also have a tiny internal cylindrical space which guards against snaps and breaks when mounting.

Many of the common side pieces are included - the flat angle brackets (and inverted variants), the L brackets, and the flats. These will accommodate most of the tool hanging centerpieces.

These will still require a spacer piece against the wall.
